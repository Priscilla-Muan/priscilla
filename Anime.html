            <h2>Animation Studios in Japan</h2>
            <p>With Anime being one of Japan's largest money-making industries, there are assuredly more than one animation studio in Japan. Among the hundreds of studios, there are three that produce many anime films. The studios that are most famous are Kyoto Animation, Toei Animation, and A-1 Pictures.</p>
            <p>First, Kyoto Animation is a Japanese animation studio and light novel publisher located in Uji, Kyoto Prefecture.  A prefecture is like a state in the United States. It was established in 1981, and as of 2015, the company has produced more than 21 anime series and numerous movies. However, tragically, on July 18, 2019, a fire broke out at Kyoto Animation. After investigation, it was confirmed to have been an act of arson. Of the 71 people in the building, 36 died and 34 were injured. Some notable works are Lucky Star (2007), K-On!, K-On!! (2009-2010), Nichijo (2011), Sound! Euphonium (2015), Sound! Euphonium 2 (2016), and Miss Kobyashi'ss Dragon Maid (2017).</p><br>
